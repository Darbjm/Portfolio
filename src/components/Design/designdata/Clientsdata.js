I worked within our creative team to design the experaince and artworks, and was project managing the site with another member of ALTER.', 'We invited festival goers to unleash their inner artist in the CANVAS area, where a journey of creation saw cocktails transformed into works of art. Starting with the blank canvas of a recyclable Bombay Sapphire cup, consumers explored a range of special sensory experiences, all designed to unleash their creative potential.', 'Kicking off the experience was the Paint Station, where consumers were able to apply edible paint to their cup. They were then invited to choose a measure of Bombay Sapphire at the imaGINation station, with a bespoke art installation from Dublin artist Anna Doran pictured left. Bartenders were on hand to guide consumers to a DIY tonic wall and advise on a selection of three tonics before they arrived at our garnish garden, filled with live plants and fresh garnishes for consumers to hand-pick from, with our gardener available to help out.'],

In 2019, the brand teamed up with Sao Paulo street artist and environmentalist Arlin Graff. The collaboration saw the creation of three limited edition IPÊ flip flop designs, each donating a percentage of profits back to the Amazonian rainforest. To further highlight the cause, Graff took to Redchurch Street in London’s Shoreditch, spray-painting an entire wall of a building to celebrate his work. The artwork contained a plaque detailing why Graff’s work was so important in highlighting the ongoing issues faced in the Amazonian Rainforest and throughout the world as animals continue to become endangered.', 'I was asked to photograph the launch event and produce artwork. Teaming up with Global Street Art and Wonderland Magazine, the collaboration was further amplified through an event in the heart of Shoreditch and digital assets not only showcasing the project, but introducing audiences to Arlin Graff and the Havaianas IPE partnership.'],

Utilising the new proposition of ‘Great Tech, Great Price’, attacking the market with an integrated comms strategy, targeting families in the C2DE demographic, focusing on non-London regions, and leading with the brand-new 3V handset that was selling at £120, at the same time as a £1000 iPhone had launched. PR coverage was achieved in every single tabloid and mainstream newspaper, with many journalists and tech editors positioning it as the ‘best value’ phone on the market. Our proposition also helped to achieve widespread online coverage with key gadget and comparison sites – along with the Channel 5 programme, The Gadget Show.', 'All media coverage featured a call to action, ensuring we were driving our mainstream audience into household name retailers such as Tesco, Argos and Carphone Warehouse. Brand-changing pieces of coverage were achieved on the 3V handset alone. I was tasked with produce digital artwork, adverts and lifetstyle photography. Our experienced Head of Digital implemented a digital media plan, combining social media, SEO and AdWords to achieve online awareness.', 'We worked with relevant influencers to also develop content around buying a great piece of tech at an affordable price – targeting both Gen Z tech focused personalities and family/mum influencers. This content was then shared across their high reaching social platforms – and amplified through the branded channels we operate. Results of The People’s Champion campaign included:'],
