    text: 'Don Facundo Bacardí himself threw legendary parties at the family home in Santiago De Cuba to celebrate the harvesting of the sugar cane crop – so we created the renowned Casa Bacardí campaign, an experiential concept that has been selling amazing drinks and cocktails at music festivals around the world every year since 1996. We championed the perfect serve, drove bartender advocacy and built consumer belief in Bacardí’s rich heritage and family plight.',

    text: 'Bombay Sapphire chose ALTER as their agency partner to launch the CANVAS campaign at Electric Picnic 2019, their first festival activation globally. We invited festival goers to unleash their inner artist in the CANVAS area, where a journey of creation saw cocktails transformed into works of art. Starting with the blank canvas of a recyclable Bombay Sapphire cup, consumers explored a range of special sensory experiences, all designed to unleash their creative potential. Kicking off the experience was the Paint Station, where consumers were able to apply edible paint to their cup. They were then invited to choose a measure of Bombay Sapphire at the imaGINation station, with a bespoke art installation from Dublin artist Anna Doran pictured left. Bartenders were on hand to guide consumers to a DIY tonic wall and advise on a selection of three tonics before they arrived at our garnish garden, filled with live plants and fresh garnishes for consumers to hand-pick from, with our gardener available to help out.',

    text: 'Havaianas have long worked with IPE (Instituto de Pesquisas Ecológicas, aka Institute for Ecological Research), a charity which supports the Amazonian Rainforest. This year, the brand teamed up with Sao Paulo street artist and environmentalist Arlin Graff. The collaboration saw the creation of three limited edition IPÊ flip flop designs, each donating a percentage of profits back to the Amazonian rainforest. To further highlight the cause, Graff took to Redchurch Street in London’s Shoreditch, spray-painting an entire wall of a building to celebrate his work. The artwork contained a plaque detailing why Graff’s work was so important in highlighting the ongoing issues faced in the Amazonian Rainforest and throughout the world as animals continue to become endangered. Teaming up with Global Street Art and Wonderland Magazine, the collaboration was further amplified through an event in the heart of Shoreditch and digital assets not only showcasing the project, but introducing audiences to Arlin Graff and the Havaianas IPE partnership.',

    text: 'We are honoured to have represented Alcatel UK & Ireland for the past decade. A long term client relationship that began with us managing traditional PR and media relations – and has since grown and evolved to a fully integrated marketing service. In 2018, we worked hand in hand with the UK team to develop The People’s Champion campaign. Utilising our new proposition of ‘Great Tech, Great Price’, we attacked the market with an integrated comms strategy, targeting families in the C2DE demographic, focusing on non-London regions, and leading with the brand-new 3V handset that was selling at £120, at the same time as a £1000 iPhone had launched. PR coverage was achieved in every single tabloid and mainstream newspaper, with many journalists and tech editors positioning it as the ‘best value’ phone on the market. Our proposition also helped to achieve widespread online coverage with key gadget and comparison sites – along with the Channel 5 programme, The Gadget Show. All media coverage featured a call to action, ensuring we were driving our mainstream audience into household name retailers such as Tesco, Argos and Carphone Warehouse. Brand-changing pieces of coverage were achieved on the 3V handset alone. Our experienced Head of Digital implemented a digital media plan, combining social media, SEO and AdWords to achieve online awareness. We worked with relevant influencers to also develop content around buying a great piece of tech at an affordable price – targeting both Gen Z tech focused personalities and family/mum influencers. This content was then shared across their high reaching social platforms – and amplified through the branded channels we operate. Results of The People’s Champion campaign included: 1.Over 487k activations from q2-q4 2.Over 50 million Google Display Ad viewers, 3. 865.2k people reached on Twitter, 4. 2.89 million people reached on Facebook, 5. Outdoor media campaigns launched in the UK & Ireland',
