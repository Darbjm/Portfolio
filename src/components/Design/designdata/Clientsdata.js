    text: 'Don Facundo Bacardí himself threw legendary parties at the family home in Santiago De Cuba to celebrate the harvesting of the sugar cane crop – so we created the renowned Casa Bacardí campaign, an experiential concept that has been selling amazing drinks and cocktails at music festivals around the world every year since 1996. We championed the perfect serve, drove bartender advocacy and built consumer belief in Bacardí’s rich heritage and family plight.',

    text: 'Bombay Sapphire chose ALTER as their agency partner to launch the CANVAS campaign at Electric Picnic 2019, their first festival activation globally. We invited festival goers to unleash their inner artist in the CANVAS area, where a journey of creation saw cocktails transformed into works of art. Starting with the blank canvas of a recyclable Bombay Sapphire cup, consumers explored a range of special sensory experiences, all designed to unleash their creative potential. Kicking off the experience was the Paint Station, where consumers were able to apply edible paint to their cup. They were then invited to choose a measure of Bombay Sapphire at the imaGINation station, with a bespoke art installation from Dublin artist Anna Doran. Bartenders were on hand to guide consumers to a DIY tonic wall and advise on a selection of three tonics before they arrived at our garnish garden, filled with live plants and fresh garnishes for consumers to hand-pick from, with our gardener available to help out.',
