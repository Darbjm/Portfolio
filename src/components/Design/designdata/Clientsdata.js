    text: 'Don Facundo Bacardí himself threw legendary parties at the family home in Santiago De Cuba to celebrate the harvesting of the sugar cane crop – so we created the renowned Casa Bacardí campaign, an experiential concept that has been selling amazing drinks and cocktails at music festivals around the world every year since 1996. We championed the perfect serve, drove bartender advocacy and built consumer belief in Bacardí’s rich heritage and family plight.',
