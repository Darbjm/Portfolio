        My passion for solutions is perfectly suited to software development. As a faster learner, I have experience in a vast array of hard skills, but found nothing as satisfying as OOP. These skills coupled with winning a design award from the Design Museum have taught me that attention to detail and deep knowledge are vital.
        Having always been interested in tech I designed a 1st grade app while at Central St Martins and continued its development after graduating. I have worked within digital creative teams with clients such as Nike, Bombay Sapphire, Havaianas, and Bacardi. Whilst there I took on extra work teaching myself to upgrade hardware, setup and update our server networks and clients' websites.
        I understand I have barely scratched the surface of what is possible and look forward to broadening and specialising my skills, whilst exploring technologies and techniques and creating new efficient systems with them.
