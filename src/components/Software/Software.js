                From software to hardware to design to photography and art, learning new skills that allow me to create and help others has great meaning for me. As <strong className='primary'>a fast learner,</strong> I have experience in a <strong className='primary'>vast array of hard skills,</strong> but found nothing as satisfying as OOP. These skills coupled with <strong className='primary'>winning a design award from the Design Museum</strong> have taught me that attention to detail and deep knowledge are vital. 
                <br/> <br/>Having always been interested in tech I <strong className='primary'>designed a 1st grade app</strong> while at Central St Martins and continued its development after graduating. I have worked within digital creative teams with clients such as <strong className='primary'>Nike, Bombay Sapphire, Havaianas, and Bacardi.</strong> Whilst there I took on extra work teaching myself to upgrade hardware, setup and update our server networks and clients' websites.
                <br/> <br/>I understand I have barely scratched the surface of what is possible and look forward to <strong className='primary'>broadening and specialising my skills,</strong> whilst exploring technologies and techniques to <strong className='primary'>create new efficient systems.</strong>
